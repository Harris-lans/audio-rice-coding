# Compression of Audio Files using the Rice Coding Algorithm

This project was done as part of the end term assessment in the Intelligent Signal Processing module during my Bachelor's in Computer Science program at the University of London. The project focuses and analysing the feasibility of using rice coding algorithm as a compression algorithm for audio files.
